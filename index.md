## Introduction
This webpage documents my progress through ECE 4960: Design and Implementation of Fast Robots in its Spring 2022 offering at Cornell University! Each of the labs below demonstrate incremental development of the robotic platform in this course, starting from microcontroller and robot characterization up to complex planning and control execution tasks.

[LAB 1: ARTEMIS](./lab1.html)

Lab 1 covers the usage of the Artemis Nano microcontroller through a series of basic examples illustrating the various abilities of the board.
