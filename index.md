## Introduction
This webpage documents my progress through ECE 4960: Design and Implementation of Fast Robots in its Spring 2022 offering at Cornell University! Each of the labs below demonstrate incremental development of the robotic platform in this course, starting from microcontroller and robot characterization up to complex planning and control execution tasks.

[LAB 1: ARTEMIS](./lab1.html)

Lab 1 covers the usage of the Artemis Nano microcontroller through a series of basic examples illustrating the various abilities of the board.

[LAB 2: BLUETOOTH](./lab2.html)

Lab 2 walks through Bluetooth communication with the Artemis Nano by testing and developing communication characteristics with the microcontroller.

[LAB 3: SENSORS](./lab3.html)

Lab 3 involves setting up the time of flight sensors and inertial measurement unit with the Artemis Nano and investigating their functionality.

[LAB 4: CHARACTERIZE THE CAR](./lab4.html)

Lab 4 allows us to characterize the physical parameters of the car that will be used as our robot, and studies the performance of relevant aspects of the car with remote control.


[LAB 5: OPEN LOOP CONTROL](./lab5.html)

Lab 5 requires us to factor in the motor drivers to our hardware setup and mount all the hardware on the robot before trying some basic open loop control commands.

[LAB 6: CLOSED LOOP CONTROL](./lab6.html)

Under Construction.

[LAB 7: KALMAN FILTER](./lab7.html)

Under Construction.

[LAB 8: STUNTS!](./lab8.html)

Under Construction.

[LAB 9: MAPPING](./lab9.html)

Lab 9 starts the second sequence of assignments by making the robot map a static environment that will ultimately be used for localization and planning tasks.
